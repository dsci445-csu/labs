We will continue to use the `Wage` data set in the `ISLR` package to predict `wage` for $3,000$ mid-atlantic male workers.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ISLR)
library(tidyverse) 
library(knitr)

str(Wage)
```


## Polynomial Regression and Step Functions

1. Fit a degree-4 polynomial regression model predicting `wage` based on `age`. Inspect your model and describe the fit. [**Hint**: you can use the `step_poly` function to create your polynomials.]
  
2. Choose your degree of polynomial using a cross validation approach. What degree model would you pick?

3. Fit a step function for `age` predicting `wage` with $4$ cut points. You can use the function `step_discretize` to change your quantitative variable into a categorical one. Let `step_discretize` automatically choose the cut locations based on your data.

## Regression Splines

To fit regression splines, we will use `step_bs` and `step_ns` in the recipe. The `step_bs` function generates a matrix of basis functions for regression splines (defaults cubic) based on a vector of knots or a specified degree of freedom. The `ns` function is the same for natural splines.

We can use either of these functions with our usual linear model.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
linear_spec <- linear_reg()

## automatically chosen knots
spline_rec <- recipe(y ~ x, data = df) |>
  step_bs(degree = 3, deg_free = 6) ## cubic spline with 2 knots & intercept

## user specified knots
spline_rec2 <- recipe(y ~ x, data = df) |>
  step_bs(degree = 3, options = list(knots = c(0, 5))) ## cubic spline with 2 knots & intercept

bs_workflow <- workflow() |>
  add_model(linear_spec) |>
  add_recipe(spline_rec)

bs_fit <- fit(bs_workflow, data = df)
```

1. Fit `wage` on `age` using a cubic regression spline with knots at ages $25, 40, 60$. 

1. Fit `wage` on `age` using a cubic regression spline with 6 degrees of freedom and knots chosen uniformly on the quantiles of the data (this is how `step_bs` does it by default).

1. Fit `wage` on `age` using a natural cubic regression spline with 6 degrees of freedom and knots chosen uniformly on the quantiles of the data.

1. Create a scatter plot of `wage` vs `age` with all three of your fitted splines overlayed as well as your chosen polynomial model (either by anova or CV). Comment on the shapes. [**Hint:** `predict` over a grid of `age` values might be helpful.]

## GAMs

1. Fit a GAM using natural spline functions of `year` and `age`, treating `education` as a categorical predictor.
