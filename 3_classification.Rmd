## Stock Market Data

1. Load and explore (through numerical and graphical summaries) the `Smarket` data (this is in `ISLR` package). 

This data contains percentage returns for the S\&P 500 stock index over 1,250 days (2001 - 2005). For each date, we have the percentage returns of the five previous days (`Lag1` - `Lag5`), the number of shares traded on the previous day in billions (`Volume`), percentage return on the date in question (`Today`) and `Direction` (`Up` or `Down` on this date).

## Logistic Regression

1. Fit a logistic regression model to predict `Direction` using `Lag1` through `Lag5` and `Volume`. Describe your results.

2. Use the `predict` and the `table` function to create a confusion matrix for the training data.

3. What is the overall error rate of the model?

4. Create two data sets, `train` and `test` that correspond to the observations from 2001 to 2004 (`train`) and 2005 (`test`).

5. Repeat 1-3, but obtain the test confusion matrix and error rate.

6. Repeat 5, but with a model of `Direction` on `Lag1` and `Lag2` only.

## LDA

1. Fit a linear discriminant analysis model (see the `MASS` library) to the `train` data set you created in the previous section with `Direction` as the response and `Lag1` and `Lag2` as the predictors.

2. What are the values for $\hat{\pi}_1$ and $\hat{\pi}_2$?

3.  Use the `predict` and the `table` function to create a confusion matrix for the `test` data.

4. What is the test error rate?

## QDA 

1. Fit a quadratic discriminant analysis model to the `train` data set you created in the previous section with `Direction` as the response and `Lag1` and `Lag2` as the predictors.

2.  Use the `predict` and the `table` function to create a confusion matrix for the `test` data.

3. What is the test error rate?

## KNN

1. Fit a KNN model with $K = 1$ (see the `class` library) to the `train` data set you created in the previous section with `Direction` as the response and `Lag1` and `Lag2` as the predictors.

2. Use `table` function to create a confusion matrix for the `test` data.

3. What is the test error rate?

4. Repeat 1.-3. with $K = 3$ and $K = 5$.

Of all the models you fit today, which would you pick to predict values of `Direction` and why?
