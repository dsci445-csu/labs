## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** *button* a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1. This is a list
1. also this
1. number


- bullets
- list
- items
  - apple
  - orange
  - banana
  
This is some math: $y = mx + \epsilon$.
$$
Y = X^\top \beta + \epsilon
$$

latex + format

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r, fig.cap="This is a histogram.", fig.height=2, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold', cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(num = 1:5, let = c("a", "b", "a", "b", "c"))

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(num), bins = 3)

ggplot(df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(num), bins = 3)

library(knitr)

kable(df, caption = "This is my table.")
```

The mean of my data is `r mean(df$num)`.



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
