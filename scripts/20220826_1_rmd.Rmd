## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.cap="This is a scatterplot!"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
my_mean <- function(x, na.rm = FALSE) {
  if(na.rm) {
    x <- na.omit(x)
  }
  if(!(class(x) %in% c("numeric", "logical"))) {
    stop("Please pass a numeric or logical vector.")
  }
  if(class(x) == "logical") {
    x <- as.numeric(x)
  }
  return(sum(x) / length(x))
}
```

```{r}
my_mean(runif(100))
```
