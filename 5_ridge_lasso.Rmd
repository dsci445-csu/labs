We will use the `Hitters` data set in the `ISLR` package to predict `Salary` for baseball players.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ISLR)
library(tidyverse) 
library(knitr)

str(Hitters)
```

## Data Processing

1. Remove records with missing values from the data (Hint: `complete.cases()` is useful)
2. Use `model.matrix` to create an $X$ matrix for all predictors that contains dummy variables for categorical predictors (for predicting `Salary`). You can specify this as a formula in the `model.matrix` call, e.g. 
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    x <- model.matrix(y ~ ., data)[, -1] # remove the y column
    ```
3. Create a $Y$ vector of `Salary` information.

## Ridge Regression

The `glmnet()` function in the `glmnet` package can perform both ridge regression and the lasso. This is done with the specification of a parameter `alpha`. If `alpha = 0` then a ridge regression model is fit and if `alpha = 1`  then the lasso is fit.

By default, `glmnet` performs ridge regression for an automatically selected range of values, but we can instead pass a vector of values.

1. Create a vector of $\lambda$ values from $\lambda = .01$ to  $\lambda = 10^10$ of length $100$.
2. Fit a ridge regression model for each $\lambda$ in your grid.

  Note, by default `glmnet` will standardize the $X$ variables.

3. Make a line plot of coefficient corresponding to each $\lambda$. You should have an individual line for each variable with coefficient value on the $y$-axis and $\lambda$ on the $x$ axis. What happens to your coefficients as $\lambda$ increases?

4. Use `cv.glmnet` to perform $10$-fold cross validation and get an estimate of the test MSE for each $\lambda$ in your grid. Which $\lambda$ would you choose and why?

## Lasso

1. Fit the lasso model for each $\lambda$ in your grid.

2. Make a line plot of coefficient corresponding to each $\lambda$. You should have an individual line for each variable with coefficient value on the $y$-axis and $\lambda$ on the $x$ axis. (Hint: `coef` may be a useful function). What happens to your coefficients as $\lambda$ increases?

3. Use `cv.glmnet` to perform $10$-fold cross validation and get an estimate of the test MSE for each $\lambda$ in your grid. Which $\lambda$ would you choose and why?
