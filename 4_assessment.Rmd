We will use the `Auto` data set in the `ISLR` package.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ISLR)
library(tidyverse) 
library(knitr)
library(tidymodels)

head(Auto) %>%
  kable()
```

Before we begin, be sure to set the seed for reproducibility.

```{r}
set.seed(445)
```

## Validation Set Approach

1. Split the data into 50% training and 50% test data.
2. Fit a linear model of `mpg` on `horsepower` using your training data.
3. Estimate the test error by using test MSE.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for a cubic and quadratic model. Which model would you pick?
5. Repeat steps 1-4 after reseting the seed
    ```{r}
    set.seed(42)
    ```
6. Did you get the same results? Is this what you expected to happen?

## LOOCV

1. Get the estimate of test MSE for the linear model using LOOCV.
2. Repeat steps 2-3 for a cubic and quadratic model. Which model would you pick?

## k-Fold CV

1. Using $k = 10$-fold CV, compute the $k$-fold CV estimate of the test MSE for polynomial models of order $i = 1, \dots, 10$. (Hint: you can use the `poly` function in your formula to specify a polynomial model.)
2. Plot the estimated test MSE vs. the polynomial order.
3. Which of these models would you choose?

## Bonus

1. Write your own $k$-fold CV function that will calculate CV for the $KNN$ Regression model. You function should take as parameters
    - CV $k$ value
    - KNN $K$ value
    - Data
    - A vector of names (character) of predictor columns
    - A character string of the response column
    
    And return the estimated test MSE.
2. Use your function to estimate the test MSE using 10-fold CV for KNN models with $K = 1, 5, 10, 20, 100$ of a model predicting `mpg` using the `horsepower` predictor variable in the `Auto` data set.
3. Compare your results to the previous $k$-Fold CV method.
